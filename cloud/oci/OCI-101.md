A region is a collection of multiple, fault tolerant, independent data centers called **ADs (Availability Domains)**
Inside each AD there are multiple (3) **Fault Domains** (separate physical infrastructure inside a datacenter/AD).

All physical components in an AD are connected to a physical network that is non-oversubscribed, low latency, high speed between hosts in the same AD. On top of it, there is a Virtual network where network and storage IO is moved out of hypervisor which enables low overhead and bear-metal instances
