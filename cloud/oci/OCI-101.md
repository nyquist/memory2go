# OCI 101
## OCI Regions

Novemeber 2019:
GA: 
- 11 commercial regions: **Phoenix, Ashburn, Toronto, London, Frankfurt, Zurich, Mumbai, Seoul, Tokyo, SÃ£o Paulo, Sydney**
- 5 Government regions: **2x US Gov, 3x DoD**
- Azure interconnects: **US Gov, London**

Planned:
- 17 new commercial regions
- 3 US Government regions
- More Azure interconnects

A region is a collection of multiple, fault de-correlated (tolerant), completly independent data centers called **ADs (Availability Domains)**. Newer regions have been launched with a single AD, while classical regions (PHX, ASH, LON, FRA) have 3 ADs. For single AD regions you may need to use ADs in other regions for true DR and resiliency.

Inside each AD there are multiple (at least 3) **Fault Domains** (separate physical infrastructure inside a datacenter/AD).

All physical components in an AD are connected to a physical network that is non-oversubscribed, low latency, high speed between hosts in the same AD. On top of it, there is a Virtual network where network and storage IO is moved out of hypervisor which enables low overhead and bear-metal instances (Off-box Network Virtualization)

## OCI Differentiators
- Technical
  - Performance
    - Off-box network virtualization
    - Bare Metal + Local NVMe storage
    - All SSD Storage
    - No Network, CPU or Memory oversubscriptions
  - Battle tested
  - DB Options
  - Oracle Apps
- Business
  - Pricing (cheaper than AWS)
  - BYOLicense
  - Support from a single org for both cloud and on-prem
  - SaaS on OCI
  - SLAs on Performance, Management, Availability (others offer only Availability)
