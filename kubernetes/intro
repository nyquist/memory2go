Kubernetes clusters contains 2 types of resources:
- **Master**: coordinates the cluster: scheduling applications, maintaining desired state, scaling, rolling updates
- **Nodes**: is a VM or Physical computer that servers as a worker machine in a cluster.
  - Each node has a **Kubelet** which is an agent for managing the node and communicating with the master
  - The node should also have tools for handling containers (docker or rkt)
  - A production cluster should have a minimum of 3 nodes (why?)
  
When deploying an application to Kubernetes you tell the master to start the application containers. 
Communication between Master and Nodes is done via Kubernetes API which the master exposes. End users can also interract with the cluster via the API.
